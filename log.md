# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: FCC ES6 challenges.

**Thoughts:** I initially wanted to work on FCC back end certificate, NPM challenge. Cloud9 (now AWS owned) not recognizing "how-to-npm" command. Multiple attempts to make this work, no luck. Switched to beta.fcc ES6 challenges, no commits. Will start commits tomorrow.

**Today's Progress**: FCC ES6 challenges, night 2.

**Thoughts**: Enjoying ES6. Was already somewhat familiar with syntax changes and new features but haven't been using them. Will definitely start to use from now on. Really like function syntax.

**Today's Progress**: FCC ES6 challenges, night 3.

**Thoughts** Happy to be learning ES6 more in depth. Would like to work on project I can commit into GitHub, just for the purpose of being able to show a link to work. Having something to show in portfolio would be nice too. Onwards!
