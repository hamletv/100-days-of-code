# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: FCC ES6 challenges.

**Thoughts:** I initially wanted to work on FCC back end certificate, NPM challenge. Cloud9 (now AWS owned) not recognizing "how-to-npm" command. Multiple attempts to make this work, no luck. Switched to beta.fcc ES6 challenges, no commits. Will start commits tomorrow.

**Today's Progress**: FCC ES6 challenges, night 2.

**Thoughts**: Enjoying ES6. Was already somewhat familiar with syntax changes and new features but haven't been using them. Will definitely start to use from now on. Really like function syntax.
